# HAR-using-Keras
Comparing accuracy of two standard deep learning models like CNN and RNN on the human activity recognition dataset.

Inspired by this amazing blog (https://burakhimmetoglu.com/2017/08/22/time-series-classification-with-tensorflow/) by Burakhimmetoglu which is written in Tensorflow,I decided to code it up in Python. I have tried to copy the same architecture but have modified it a bit for the RNN's. 

The code also inlucdes an implementation of a simple Mutli-layer perceptron to compared its accuracy with the RNN's and CNN's (it works very poorly).

The main aim is to compare accuracies of different deep learning models like Recurrent Neural Nets and Convolutional Neural Nets for Time series data. The dataset used here is the Human Activity Recognition (HAR) dataset which can be found here (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/human+activity+recognition+using+smartphones). 

The Ipython notebook includes short descriptions about what each module does.

Kindly get back in case you find an error or have an issues with the same.
